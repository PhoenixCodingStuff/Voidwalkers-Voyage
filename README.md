## Information
- Voidwalkers-Voyage is a Minecraft **1.20** datapack which focuses on rehauling The End with new biomes.
- It started off as a **lite** version of FSEE.
- The pack will only be updated to major Minecraft versions, only **latest** Minecraft version will be supported.
- Though not **incompatible** it is advised not to run more than 1 world generation datapack for one dimension.
- Adding it to an already existing world/server requires you to **reset** The End.
- Previously known as FSEE, all credits to original developer.
- Originally made for [SlimeCraftSMP](https://discord.gg/xFtghGVCVD) but I decided to make it public.
- Removes most of the items and mechanics except some which I would like to keep in [SlimeCraftSMP](https://discord.gg/xFtghGVCVD).
